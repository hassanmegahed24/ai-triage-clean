Recent turns (doctor ↔ assistant):
{{ turns }}

Patient snapshot (use instead of re-asking):
{{ snapshot }}

TASK
1) Silently extract **KNOWN FACTS** from the turns + snapshot.
2) Ask **ONE** best next question that is **not already answered**; OR if discovery is essentially complete, propose a preview via:
   - intent "propose_objective" with suggested_actions ["show_objective_preview"], or
   - intent "propose_finalize" with suggested_actions ["show_soap_preview"].
3) If the doctor explicitly asked to “pull from the record/database/snapshot”, include a **concise** summary of relevant snapshot facts in `speech_output`.

Return ONLY the JSON per the system schema.
